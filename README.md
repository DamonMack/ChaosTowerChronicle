# Chaos Tower Chronicle

## Description:
Dive into the tower to prove your mettle! As your final challenge in becoming a mage, you must ascend the Chaos Tower, defeating any enemies in your way. However, things are not as they seem in the tower, and the threat quickly starts to get out of hand. How will you manage to reach the top of the tower in this spell-flinging adventure? <br>
This is a project created using Unity3D to produce a game with multiple levels and a third-person, bullet-hell-style game.
